# Personal Kanban
**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks** using <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.).
<ul>
<li>I recommend using post-its so you can move them around
OR</li>
<li>a digital representation of your milestones using <a href="http://kanbanery.com" target="_blank">kanbanery.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

The columns I recommend for Personal Kanban (but you are not limited to) are:
* To-Do
* Today (WIP limit of 3 to 5 maximum)
* Next Week
* Done

If you use Kanbanery.com, please go to **Settings**, and under **General Settings** **enable** a *public URL* and make sure you press **Update** at the bottom of the General Settings page. Then, copy and paste your public URL to slack as a comment to the specific kanbanery.com message.
