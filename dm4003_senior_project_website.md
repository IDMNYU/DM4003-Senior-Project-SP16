### DM-UY 4003 Senior Project in Digital Media
##### Spring 2016 • De Angela L. Duff • Wednesdays • 4:30-6:20PM • 2MTC MAGNET 811 

---


You should have a **dedicated**, senior project website to document your **weekly** progress/process of your senior project. Students are expected to share their progress with others using their process website.
* Ideally under your own domain name with a "thesis" folder. See Ernie's link below under Example Process Websites. 
    * I recommend [Siteground](http://siteground.com) for purchasing a domain and web hosting.
* Second best, is hosting on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu
 * You can receive web space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883. Email eltonkwok@nyu.edu to set up an appointment for your web space.
 * IDM’s FTP server info: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu (Use active mode to connect)
 * Create a *thesis* folder
 * Install wordpress in this folder
 * Make and appointment with Elton to connect a database to this particular wordpress installation



##What your senior project process website should contain?
* *Daily/Weekly Senior Progress/Process*
  * at least, 1 post per week DUE at noon on Wednesdays. If it is not posted by noon, you will not receive credit. 
  * The majority of the posts should be your own writing (well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar).
  * Project Advisor meeting notes (2-4x)
  * Accountability partner meeting notes
  * pdfs of any presentations (annotated)
  * notes taken about your project, paper, and presentations by you or your accountability partner
  * Milestones / Tasks that have been completed (transcribed from your personal kanban)
  * Include who or what was involved.
  * Include images, illustrations, audio, video, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your thesis. 
  * If you do not do anything for the week, write **I did not work on my senior project this week.**


* *An About Page*
  * The “elevator pitch” / Thesis Statement
  * A link to your pre-thesis site
  * A link to a pdf of your pre-thesis defense presentation
  * Documentation (i.e. hi-res images and/or video) of your prototype from pre-thesis


* *Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration* 
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your thesis. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.)


##What your process website should NOT contain?
* How you are feeling about your senior project? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your thesis website. 
* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer, creative technologist and/or entrepreneur. You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.
* Any content that is NOT related to your thesis explicitly.


##Examples of Process Websites
Spencer Hargiss’ project website is a good example, http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/. Please use Spencer’s project website as a guide. Why?  
* You can clearly read what his project was about due to his about link. You don’t have to wade through to the beginning of his posts to find this out. His navigation stands out due to its visual hierarchy.
* He explicitly stated what he did, concisely and clearly.
* He had visual documentation (images and screenshots). 
* However, most importantly, he had supporting text for these images and screenshots.

Also the following PDFs contain excellent examples of possible entries:
