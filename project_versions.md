# Senior Project Versions

Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle. The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.

* <strong>Alpha</strong> is the testing phase of form and functionality for your project.

* <strong>Beta</strong> is when the functionality, form, and implementation of your project is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.

* <strong>Gold</strong> is when all the bugs in your project have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public.

## FEEDBACK THROUGH USER TESTING
You should be conducting research and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project.
