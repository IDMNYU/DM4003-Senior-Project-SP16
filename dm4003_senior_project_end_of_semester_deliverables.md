# End of Semester Deliverables

## EXIT INTERVIEW SURVEY
The survey will be mailed to your NYU email account. 

## END OF SEMESTER PDF
This should be compiled using **Adobe InDesign**.

### First and Second Drafts
*Direct message to deangela as a pdf*
* Please name your file as firstnameinitiallastname_senior_sp16_#draft.pdf (i.e. dduff_senior_sp16_1stdraft.pdf and dduff_senior_sp16_2nddraft.pdf)

#### Final Version
* Please name your file as firstnameinitiallastname_senior_sp16.pdf (i.e. dduff_senior_sp16.pdf) 
* If pdf, **post on senior project channel on slack** for everyone to see and download in the class
* If physical book, bring the actual book AND provide the link to preview on blurb. Make sure the book is public and that you can preview the entire book. If you can't figure out how to preview it on blurb, upload a pdf of the book to the senior project channel on slack.

This should be compiled using **Adobe InDesign**.   

PDF Cover:
* Your first and last name
* Your Logo
* The Name of Your Project
* Senior Project in Digital Media
* Spring 2016

I would use the [project plan](dm4003_senior_project_plan.md) as a guideline for the structure, and your process website and proejct presentations for content.
 
Content should also include:
  * URL to your project website


Combine multiple pdfs using Adobe Acrobat Pro:
FILE > CREATE > COMBINE INTO A SINGLE PDF
or using Preview (Drag and Drop with thumbnail panel)


## (OPTIONAL instead of PDF) END OF SEMESTER BOOK REQUIREMENTS

This should be compiled using **Adobe InDesign**.    

See the end of semester pdf requirements above and adopt them in book format instead IF YOU WANT EXTRA CREDIT.

I highly suggest blurb
* [Blurb Formats and Pricing](http://www.blurb.com/create/book/pricing#color-pocket) ($4.95 plus shipping)
* I recommend the [Magazine format](http://www.blurb.com/pricing#magazines). It's the cheapest.
* **Shipping is 7 to 10 business days** (KEEP THIS IN MIND!)


## DOCUMENTATION FOR IDM ARCHIVES and PROMOTION

*Direct message the dropbox link or google drive folder link to deangela on slack.*

If you want to create a dropbox account and have not already done so, let me know. Both you and I can get additional free space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own **dropbox link**. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual *dropbox folder*. Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link (NOT folder, see above) or google drive folder that contains the following. Make sure all filenames include your name and ms thesis fa15 and descriptive text of the content: 

Photo documentation (for all students)
    * ***at least*** 3, hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)

Video and/or Audio documentation (varies by student)
    * If creating a screen-based, digital application (website, mobile app, game, etc.), create video documentation by screen capturing a user interacting with your digital project.
    * If creating a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation, create video documentation of a user interacting with your physical project.
    * If creating a performance or event, please provide video documentation of the performance or event.
    * If creating any sort of moving image (animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.), please provide compressed video files of your moving image.
    * If creating an audio podcast, provide mp3s of all podcasts.
    * If creating any print medium, provide an original copy of it or provide a digital copy of it (preferably pdf).
