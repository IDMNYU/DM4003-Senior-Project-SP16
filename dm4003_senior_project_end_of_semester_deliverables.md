## End of Semester Deliverables

### EXIT INTERVIEW SURVEY
Please fill out by Friday, May 15th. The survey will be mailed to your NYU email account. The URL will be inserted here once the survey is created.

### DELIVERABLES FOR IDM PROMOTION and ARCHIVE
You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own dropbox link. 

Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual dropbox folder.
 
Create a dropbox link with the following contents:
  * title of your project
  * URL to your project website
  * short text description of your project
  * *at least* 3, hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)
  * (OPTIONAL) quicktime video (for those of you doing video projects or projects that can be documented with video)
  * (for lyndsey only) mp3s of all the episodes
