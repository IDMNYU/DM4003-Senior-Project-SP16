    <td>Prototype(s) – including, but not limited to, exercises, tests, models, maquettes, animatics 
        <ul>
        <li>You should know what the concept of a prototype is but, if you do not know, a prototype “is an early sample or model built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.”</li>
        <li>As a result, a prototype can take on many forms. Essentially, it is your project or aspects of your project in an unfinished form.</li>
        <li>You should decide what kinds of prototype(s) are most appropriate for your project.</li>

    <td><strong>Prototypes / Project Versions</strong></td> 
    <td>Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle.
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Alpha</strong> Version is the testing phase of form and functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Beta</strong> Version is when the functionality, form, and implementation is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Gold</strong> Version is when all the bugs have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public.</li>
        </ul>
    The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.</td>

<tr>
    <td><strong>Project Milestones</strong></td>
    <td>
    <ul>
    <li>Break down your milestones into actionable tasks using a system of your choice.</li>
    <li>All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day.</li> 
    <li>Also be specific with your tasks. (For example, "take 20 photographs" is more explicit than "take photographs". "Take 5 photos of tigers, 5 photos of bears, 5 photos of lizards, and 5 photos of cats" is more explicit than "take 20 photographs".)</li>
    </ul>

I personally recommend <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. However, it is not required if you have another system.
<ul>
<li>I recommend using post-its so you can move them around
OR</li>
<li>a digital representation of your milestones using <a href="http://kanbanery.com" target="_blank">kanbanery.com</a>.</li>
