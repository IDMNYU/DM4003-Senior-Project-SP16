## Welcome to Senior Project In Digital Media!

**What is Senior Project in Digital Media?** Senior Project in Digital Media is the capstone course for the Integrated Digital Media program. This course mirrors the creative process that professional artists, designers, creative technologists, and entrepreneurs must practice throughout their entire careers. In order to succeed, this course requires you to devote a lot of time and effort outside of class, throughout the entire semester.

The primary goal for the student is to develop a hunger and passion for self-directed, life-long learning and creativity. To achieve this students will involve themselves in a semester-long capstone project that includes a robust investigation of all phases of the creative process, including research, design, development, and user testing for the production of a substantial and mature body of work, representing their creative and conceptual skills as artists, designers, creative technologists, and/or entrepreneurs.

As you engage in the rigorous practice of a professional artist, designer, or entrepreneur, your project will naturally evolve and change, and may in fact take quite a different shape than what you propose in the beginning of the semester. This is normal and OK.

The Senior Project can take many forms, including but not limited to the following:

* a screen-based, digital application (website, mobile app, game, etc.)
* a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation
* a performance or event,
* a moving image (animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.)
audio (podcast, etc.)
* print medium

The Senior Project **can also be a team-based project** if your teammate is also taking this semester of Senior Project.

## Your Commitment to Senior Project
Excerpt from the book *Anything You Want* by Derek Sivers

     No “yes.” 
     Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”
     If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.” 
     When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than 
     “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”
     —then say “no.” 

How are you currently feeling about your Senior Project? 
* Yes. 
* Hell Yeah! or 
* No:( 

If you are NOT feeling “Hell Yeah!” about your senior project, remember your project idea is just that YOURS. I highly suggest you read What is Senior Project in Digital Media?, again, AND the required and recommended readings NOW!

Senior Project is about the work YOU are and will continue to do, when you are no longer a student. You don’t need anyone to whip you to work because you can NOT, not do it. You will live, eat, breath, and sleep with this project. It is NOT about doing a project for a class or pleasing the Integrated Digital Media faculty. It is about you, your ideas, your concerns, your questions and your passion.

Senior Project in Digital Media is about demonstrating the maturity, responsibility, and integrity to manage your practice/research/investigation, while having the luxury of constructive critique and feedback from your fellow class mates, faculty, and outside critics. Ultimately, your goal is to COMPLETE a project that has a life beyond school, beyond graduation.


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.


### COURSE GOALS

This course will help students to:
* determine, communicate, and accomplish your own vision and goals for your senior project. 
* practice an iterative design process in conjunction with effective project & time management skills.
* continue to hone all aspects of professional communication about your creative process and work through discourse, presentations, and writing.


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a body of work that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, starting a business, etc.).


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations. 

This class will consist of 
* **Individual Meetings**<br>The order of our weekly, individual 20 minute status meetings will be determined on the first day of class. Individual meetings will be held after the project critiques. <a href="dm4003_senior_project_groups.md">We will alternate weeks between group A and B.</a> Students who do the project critique will NOT meet for individual meetings on the same day. Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are addressed *prior* to meeting with the instructor. 
Individual meetings are not optional. They are important and useful. Sometimes
they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that. If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please show professional courtesy and let me know ahead of time.
* **Class critiques**<br>Class critiques will be held for 2 to 3 seniors every Wednesday, and will consist of the professor, ALL seniors, and, at times, outside critics. 

     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 minutes of critique 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 20 minutes total. 

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to at least one of their project critiques. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, <strong>documented</strong> meeting (date, time, length, and typed notes) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Have at least one classmate take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged (i.e. Close your laptops and stow your cellphones)
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. 


### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Direct message deangela on Slack about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly after class, during your status meeting, or set up an appointment about issues and problems. DO NOT email long conversations. (If your email turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not emailing me.)


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to the weekly project critique on Wednesdays and your individual meetings on time. 
* Participate in project critiques and discussions. Be vocal.
* Present your work during project critiques at least twice during the course of the semester. 
* Meet, individually, with the professor on a weekly basis during your scheduled time to discuss your project progress.
* Consult slack at least once a week for up to date info
* Maintain a weekly, dedicated, project website
* **Back up your work constantly** 
* Complete all deliverables by their due dates
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!


### STUDENT VALUES

* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have self-motivation, proactiveness, and focus 
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory during project critiques and every student’s end of semester public presentations. 
* Missed individual meetings will not be rescheduled; students will have to wait for their next assigned meeting time.
* In the event a student has little or no progress to show, he/she is still required to attend class.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:
