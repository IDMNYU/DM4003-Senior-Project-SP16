# Project Demo

Demos will be held on designated Wednesdays, and will consist of the professor, ALL thesis students, and outside critics, at times. 

     Each demo will consist of 
     * 10 minutes of demo and 
     * 10 minutes of critique 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 20 minutes total. 

You are always welcome to invite an outside critic to your project demo. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc.  

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and/or your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. 
* Have at least two classmates take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. 
* Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said.
* Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. 
* However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged. (i.e. Close your laptops and turn off your cellphones.)
* Give Feedback to your classmates.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

### General Guidelines for your Project Demo
* You will demo the project at its current state.
* The focus is on the actual artifact you are creating and nothing else.
* Do NOT create a supporting presentation.

###Be prepared to discuss the following
From Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill's *What do Prototypes prototype?*, prototypes provide a means to 
examine design problems.
* Select the focus of a prototype to answer design questions: 
    * What does (and does not) your prototype explore?
* Evaluate whether the prototype works or not.
